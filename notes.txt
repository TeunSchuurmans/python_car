collision detection idea

    make a list of all road tiles
    check the current tile the car is on
    if a road is horizontal, check if y axis is out of tile
    if a road is vertical, check if x axis is out of tile



    have a dict of all the road pieces

    road = {
        (0,0) : hor,
        (0,0) : hor,
        (0,0) : hor,
        (0,0) : hor,
    }

    get the indexes of the current tile
        index = (self.x // TILE_SIZE , self.y // TILE_SIZE)

    
    find the tile in the dict
        road[index[0], index[1]]

    find the previous and next tile in the dict
        pass

    check collision foreach based on the tile type

    if check_collision(index):                                       def check_collision(self, index):
        pass                                                            prev_tile = 0
    else:                                                               
        self.x -= dx
        self.y -= dy
